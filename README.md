## ⚙ How to Setup
- You need to **create** a [Driver Kernel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh5cCUuQfL8&t=1090s&ab_channel=EthanEDITS) and when it's done you put the Source in the Driver folder.
- You can also use the Cheat's Driver but its detected, will get you banned in a few matches.
- It's time for fun / use it at your own risk 
- Other question & help / Message Me 
###### ❌ You cannot use public drivers like mapper because they are old versions. I recommend you to create your own will be the best. 
- I recommend to make your own driver.
